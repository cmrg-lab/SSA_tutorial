# SSA_tutorial

Example code in a jupyter notebook in how to interact with a statistical shape atlas. The atlas is downloaded from the [CAP website](https://www.cardiacatlas.org/biventricular-modes/). The jupyter notebook has code blocks that demonstrate how to:
- load in and use the atlas
- visualize the variance explained by the principal components
- visualize the mean ed and es shape of the atlas
- plot an interactive plot to see how changing the scores of the different shape modes change the shape
- project a sample patient represented in text files onto the atlas to generate shape mode scores

## How to install

1. Clone the github: `git clone https://github.com/cmrg-lab/SSA_tutorial.git`
2. Open the Juypyter notebook `ExploreAtlas_AQ_20250616.ipynb` using your tool of choice. I use VS code but of course you can open it [through the terminal](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html) as well.
3. Run the cells!
